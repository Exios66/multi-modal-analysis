# Multi-Modal Analysis Pipeline

A comprehensive Python application for analyzing psychometric, vitals, and neurological imaging data. This application provides a robust pipeline for data ingestion, preprocessing, feature extraction, correlation analysis, and machine learning modeling.

## Overview

This pipeline enables researchers and data scientists to process and analyze multi-modal data from various sources including psychometric assessments, physiological measurements, and neurological imaging. The system automates the entire workflow from raw data ingestion through analysis and visualization.

## Features

- Multi-modal data processing support:
  - Eye tracking data (fixations, saccades, pupil dilation)
  - EEG data (raw signals, frequency bands, ERPs)
  - Survey responses (psychometric scales, questionnaires)
  - Vital signs (heart rate, GSR, breathing rate)
  - Face heat maps (thermal imaging data)
  - Motion capture data
  - Voice recordings
- Automated data preprocessing and cleaning
  - Artifact removal
  - Signal filtering
